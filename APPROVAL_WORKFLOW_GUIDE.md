## üÜï Created Files

### 1. **controllers/approvalController.js** (600+ lines)

Complete approval workflow logic with four main functions.

---

## üîÑ Functions Implemented

### **a) `getPendingApprovals(req, res)` - Get Pending Approvals**

#### What It Does:
‚úÖ Gets all expenses waiting for current user's approval  
‚úÖ Filters by sequential approval logic  
‚úÖ Only shows approvals where ALL previous sequences are approved  
‚úÖ Shows expense in company's default currency  
‚úÖ Includes complete context for decision making  

#### Sequential Approval Logic:
```
Expense has 3 approvers:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (pending) ‚Üê Shows to Finance Head
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (pending) ‚Üê Hidden until Sequence 2 approves
```

#### Blocking Logic:
- Counts approvals with `sequence < current_sequence` AND `status != 'approved'`
- If count > 0, approval is blocked (not shown)
- Only shows approvals ready for action

#### Response Includes:
- **Approval details**: ID, sequence, created date
- **Expense details**: Amount (converted), category, description, date, receipt
- **Submitter info**: Name, email
- **Company info**: Name, currency
- **Approval context**:
  - Total approvals needed
  - How many already approved
  - Current sequence number
  - Previous approvers with their decisions

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "pending_approvals": [
    {
      "approval_id": "uuid",
      "sequence": 2,
      "expense": {
        "id": "expense-uuid",
        "amount": 275.55,
        "original_amount": 250.50,
        "original_currency": "EUR",
        "company_currency": "USD",
        "category": "Travel",
        "description": "Client meeting",
        "date": "2025-10-04",
        "receipt_url": "/uploads/file.jpg"
      },
      "submitter": {
        "id": "user-uuid",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@company.com"
      },
      "company": {
        "name": "Tech Corp",
        "currency": "USD"
      },
      "approval_context": {
        "total_approvals": 3,
        "approved_count": 1,
        "current_sequence": 2,
        "previous_approvers": [
          {
            "name": "Jane Manager",
            "status": "approved",
            "approved_at": "2025-10-04T10:00:00Z",
            "comments": "Approved - valid expense"
          }
        ]
      },
      "created_at": "2025-10-04T09:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

---

### **b) `approveExpense(req, res)` - Approve Expense**

#### Validation Steps:
1. ‚úÖ **Approval exists** - Check approval record exists
2. ‚úÖ **User is approver** - Validate `approver_id === current_user.id`
3. ‚úÖ **Approval is pending** - Cannot approve already processed approval
4. ‚úÖ **Expense is pending** - Cannot approve rejected/approved expense
5. ‚úÖ **Sequential validation** - All previous sequences must be approved

#### Sequential Approval Validation:
```sql
SELECT id, status, sequence
FROM approvals
WHERE expense_id = $1 AND sequence < $2
ORDER BY sequence ASC
```
- If ANY previous approval is not 'approved' ‚Üí Reject with error
- Error: "Sequential approval violation: Approval sequence X must be approved first"

#### Approval Process:
1. **Update approval** to 'approved' with timestamp and comments
2. **Check remaining approvals**:
   - Query for approvals with `sequence > current_sequence`
   - If none exist ‚Üí Expense is fully approved
   - If exist ‚Üí Check if all are approved
3. **Apply conditional rules** (if configured):
   - **Percentage rule**: Check if X% of approvers have approved
   - **Specific approver rule**: Check if special approver approved
4. **Update expense status**:
   - If fully approved ‚Üí Set expense status to 'approved'
   - Otherwise ‚Üí Keep as 'pending'

#### Conditional Rules Support:
```javascript
// Percentage Rule Example
{
  "rule_type": "percentage",
  "rule_config": {
    "required_percentage": 75  // 75% approval needed
  }
}

// If 3 out of 4 approvers approve (75%), expense auto-approves
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Expense approved successfully",
  "approval": {
    "id": "approval-uuid",
    "expense_id": "expense-uuid",
    "sequence": 2,
    "status": "approved",
    "comments": "Approved - valid business expense",
    "approved_at": "2025-10-04T11:00:00Z",
    "approver": {
      "name": "Finance Head",
      "email": "finance@company.com"
    }
  },
  "expense": {
    "id": "expense-uuid",
    "status": "pending",  // or "approved" if fully approved
    "fully_approved": false  // or true
  },
  "next_approver": {
    "name": "CEO",
    "email": "ceo@company.com",
    "sequence": 3
  }
}
```

---

### **c) `rejectExpense(req, res)` - Reject Expense**

#### Validation Steps:
1. ‚úÖ **Comments required** - Must provide rejection reason
2. ‚úÖ **Approval exists** - Check approval record exists
3. ‚úÖ **User is approver** - Validate `approver_id === current_user.id`
4. ‚úÖ **Approval is pending** - Cannot reject already processed approval
5. ‚úÖ **Expense is pending** - Cannot reject already rejected/approved expense

#### Rejection Process:
1. **Update approval** to 'rejected' with comments and timestamp
2. **Update expense** status to 'rejected'
3. **Reject all other pending approvals**:
   - Sets status to 'rejected'
   - Adds comment: "Rejected due to prior rejection in approval chain"
   - No further approvals needed

#### Cascade Effect:
```
Expense with 3 approvers:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (REJECTS) ‚úó
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (auto-rejected) ‚úó

Result: Expense status = 'rejected'
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Expense rejected successfully",
  "approval": {
    "id": "approval-uuid",
    "expense_id": "expense-uuid",
    "sequence": 2,
    "status": "rejected",
    "comments": "Insufficient documentation provided",
    "approved_at": "2025-10-04T11:00:00Z",
    "approver": {

Approval Chain Created:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (pending)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (pending)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (pending)

Step 1: Manager approves
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (pending) ‚Üê Now visible
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (pending) ‚Üê Still hidden

Step 2: Finance Head approves
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (approved) ‚úì
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (pending) ‚Üê Now visible

Step 3: CEO approves
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (approved) ‚úì
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (approved) ‚úì

Result: Expense status = 'approved' ‚úì
```

### Example 2: Rejection at Sequence 2

```
Employee submits $500 expense
‚Üì
Approval Chain Created:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (pending)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (pending)

Step 1: Manager approves
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (pending)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (pending)

Step 2: Finance Head REJECTS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager (approved) ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Finance Head (rejected) ‚úó
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: CEO (auto-rejected) ‚úó

Result: Expense status = 'rejected' ‚úó
No further approvals processed
```

### Example 3: Percentage Rule (75% Required)

```
Expense has 4 approvers, 75% approval needed
‚Üì
Approval Chain:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 1: Manager 1 (pending)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 2: Manager 2 (pending)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sequence 3: Finance (pending)
