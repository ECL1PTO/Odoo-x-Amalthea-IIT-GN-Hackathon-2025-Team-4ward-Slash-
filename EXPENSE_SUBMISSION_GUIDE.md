### 2. **controllers/expenseController.js** - Expense Management Logic

#### Functions Implemented:

**a) `submitExpense(req, res)` - Submit New Expense**
- âœ… Validates all required fields (amount, currency, category, date)

- âœ… **Converts amount to company currency** using `convertCurrency()`
- âœ… Stores both original and converted amounts
- âœ… Handles optional receipt file upload
- âœ… Creates expense with status 'pending'
- âœ… **Builds approval chain:**
  - If user has manager â†’ adds manager as first approver (sequence 1)
  - Fetches additional approvers from `approvers` table
  - Creates approval records in sequence order
  - Auto-approves if admin with no approvers
- âœ… Uses SQL transaction for atomicity
- âœ… Deletes uploaded file if transaction fails
- âœ… Returns expense with full approval chain

**c) `getExpenseById(req, res)` - Get Single Expense**
- âœ… Gets expense with submitter and company details
- âœ… **Role-based access control:**

  - Employee: can only see own expenses
- âœ… Returns full approval chain with approver details

### 3. **routes/expenses.js** - Clean Route Definitions

#### Routes Implemented:
- âœ… `POST /api/expenses` - Submit expense (with file upload)
- âœ… `GET /api/expenses/my` - Get user's expenses
- âœ… `GET /api/expenses/:id` - Get expense by ID
- âœ… `GET /api/expenses` - Get all expenses (filtered)

---

## ðŸ”„ Approval Chain Logic

### How It Works:

1. **User submits expense** â†’ Creates expense record with status 'pending'

2. **Check for manager:**
   - If user has `manager_id` â†’ Create approval for manager (sequence 1)
   - Manager gets first approval responsibility

3. **Check for additional approvers:**
   - Query `approvers` table for company
   - Add each approver in sequence order
   - Skip if approver is same as manager (avoid duplicate)

4. **Special case:**
   - If no approvers found AND user is admin â†’ Auto-approve

5. **Result:**
   - Expense has complete approval chain
   - Approvals created with status 'pending'
   - Each approval has sequence number for ordering

### Example Approval Chain:

```
Expense: $500 Travel Expense
â”œâ”€â”€ Approval 1 (sequence: 1) - Manager John - Status: pending
â”œâ”€â”€ Approval 2 (sequence: 2) - Finance Head - Status: pending
â””â”€â”€ Approval 3 (sequence: 3) - CEO - Status: pending
```

## ðŸ’± Currency Conversion

### Features:

**Automatic Conversion:**
- User submits expense in any currency (e.g., EUR)
- System fetches company's base currency (e.g., USD)
- Converts amount using real-time exchange rates
- Stores both original and converted amounts

**Caching Strategy:**
- Exchange rates cached for 1 hour
- Reduces API calls significantly
- Falls back to expired cache if API fails
- Cache key format: `{FROM}_{TO}` (e.g., `EUR_USD`)

**Error Handling:**
- API timeout: Uses cached rate if available
- Invalid currency: Returns clear error message
- Network error: Graceful fallback
- Same currency: No conversion needed (optimization)

### Example:

```javascript
// User submits: 100 EUR
// Company currency: USD
// Exchange rate: 1 EUR = 1.10 USD

Stored in database:
{
  amount: 110.00,              // Converted to company currency
  original_amount: 100.00,     // Original amount
  original_currency: 'EUR'     // Original currency
}
```

---

## ðŸ”’ Security & Validation

### Input Validation:
âœ… Amount must be positive number  
âœ… Currency code must be 3 characters  
âœ… Category is required  
âœ… Date must be valid format  
âœ… File must be image or PDF  
âœ… File size max 5MB  

### Access Control:
âœ… **Submit expense**: Employee, Manager (authenticated)  
âœ… **View own expenses**: All authenticated users  
âœ… **View team expenses**: Manager, Admin  
âœ… **View all expenses**: Admin only  

### SQL Security:
âœ… Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection  
âœ… Transactions ensure data consistency  
âœ… Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
